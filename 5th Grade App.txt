5th Grade Math Web App

When tasked with changing the world one thing that was brought up was 
how can we change things at our jobs. Since my job is not something that
can be automated or really made easier I spoke with my wife who is a 5th
grade teacher.  She said one thing that would "change her world" would be 
something that was web based for her math program. She is looking for a 
program where the students can either complete the problems online or 
be able to print them out at home and bring them back to school. 

This program would need to be very simple for both the students to 
navigate as well as the teachers be able to set up and manipulate. 
This would need to be able to allow teachers to put in the answers 
required from the students and determine if the students answers are 
correct/incorrect. Once the assignment is graded/submitted the form would 
then email the teacher with the students score and answers.


Music can tame the wild beast or inspire an entire nation. The power of music can change the world and this app puts that power to your lips. 
Our app has the traditional fingering of a bamboo flute and is played by blowing on the microphone of your phone. The question is not how will 
our app change the world, but how will you change the world with our app? Will you sooth your audience with tranquil sounds or lead them to 
action with a triumphant anthem?
