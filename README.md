This is the repository for the Scorching 8!!

After sizing up the other teams it is clear that our team has the least amount of experience writing code. 
We are also the most likely to produce a working piece of software before the class is over.
We can do this by setting clear and realistic goals for our project. We are a team! several of you have looked worried
about the scope of our projects as if you would have to complete the entire thing on your own. You don't have to. You will
only have to figure out a part of it and you will have help doing it if you need it.
The biggest hurdle is getting started you need to decide which ideas to submit. 
The deadline to submit is almost here but it’s the next deadline we need to be worried about. 
I am still voting for 5th grade math and bamboo flute. 
I could be persuaded if someone wants to put up a good argument for a different combination.

You thought you had survived 5th grade math and armed with your fancy pocket calculator you were confident that you
would never again have to go through the torture of  spending hours practicing simple arithmetic. Now your darling child
is entering the FITH GRADE and is triggering your PTSD. Your only opptions are; sell the child for scientific experiments,
or re-live the horrors from the kitchen table of your childhood. Well we are happy to offer you a third option. Our math 
tutor and homework program will break the cycle of terror being passed from generation to generation. 

Teachers we are here for you. If the thought of correcting one more snot covered math homework that was probbably barely 
legible in the first place is just to much. Let us do it for you. Choose the type of problems and the number of problems 
and send the students on their way. Oh you want to know who needs help on what type of problem? Let us 
correct the homework and you will have more time spend on actual teaching. Our program will highlight the problem areas
for each student allowing you to focus your efforts on what will make the biggest impact on their learning.
