First, we need to complete our two project wordwrap.  We're not clear on them.

NO!!

Ya!

Please explain your fears so that I can take better advantage of them… err I mean aahh…help you work through them. 
As I see it we are arranging imaginary 1s and 0s. If we put them in the wrong order it’s not 
like half of downtown and the whole west side will suddenly be without phone service. 
Besides, I’ve already done that. I don’t really recommend it as an exercise in personal growth. 
This is a learning experience, you are not expected to already know how to do it. 
That is why I am in this class, to learn how to develop a piece of software. I’m not sure if I can learn 
that without some hands on practice. Actually completing something would be nice but I don’t really care if 
it is a complete and utter failure as long as I learn something and PRACTICE what I learn. 
Different programing languages are just different tools for arranging 1s and 0s. 
A smart phone is just another input device with a weak processor that outputs to a screen that is too small, 
and a speaker that sucks.

So what are you afraid of?

I guess I am thinking I am afraid not of not being able to contribute and therefore
not get a decent grade in this class. I don't hate the idea of a phone app, I am just not sure how to even
begin the process so I guess my greatest fear is of the unknown. - cw

I am afraid of "biting off more than we can chew." I want to contribue as much as I can but 
I may need some direction. Most of what we're planning to do is new to me. I want to pass this class
and learn as much as I am able and juggle my other classes with work, but I'm afraid I'll be overwhelmed.
That is what I'm afraid of. -kb
